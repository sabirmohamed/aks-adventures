# Microservices

## Sock Shop
#### Sock Shop microservices are designed to have minimal expectations, using DNS to find other services. This means that it is possible to insert load-balancers and service routers, as required or desired.

There are pre-built configuration scripts for various platforms that aim to make running the whole application simple.

Sock Shop can be used to illustrate microservices architectures, demonstrate platforms at talks and meetups, or as a training and education tool.

## podinfo
#### Podinfo is a tiny web application made with Go that showcases best practices of running microservices in Kubernetes. Podinfo is used by CNCF projects like Flux and Flagger for end-to-end testing and workshops
